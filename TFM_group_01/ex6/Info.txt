Hi colleague,

Please find bellow some details about the experiments that I ran last week.
Hans was very interested in looking at the total force for each case...

Thank you!

Cells chosen were cultured on PAA gels (Poisson ratio ~0.48) coated in collagen with different stiffness:

- low  stiffness: 1.4 kPa.
	-> xyResolution (microns) 0.35

- high stiffness: 4.5 kPa.
	-> xyResolution (microns) 0.39
